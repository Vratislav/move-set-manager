## Features

*   üíæ **Backup and Restoration:** Easily back up your Ableton Move sets and restore them when needed.
*   üìÑ **Paging Support:** Organize your sets into pages. Upload an entire page of sets to your Move in seconds.
*   ‚úèÔ∏è **Metadata Editing:** Modify set details such as song name and pad color.
*   ‚è≥ **(Coming Soon!) Versioning Support:** Keep track of changes to your sets with version control.

## Caveats

*   üö´‚òÅÔ∏è This tool does not play well with cloud synced sets. Please disable cloud syncing for sets if you want to use the upload functionality.
*   Syncing sets between devices works only for sets that do not have any custom samples. Proper support for this will be added soon.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get Move Set Manager up and running on your system.

### Prerequisites

*   **SSH Access to your Move:** You'll need to have SSH access configured for your Ableton Move.
    *   Add an SSH key at `http://move.local/development/ssh`.
    *   Right now only SSH keys without passphrase are supported by the Move Set Manager. Support for passphrases will be added soon.
    *   If you don't have an SSH key, you can generate one. GitHub provides excellent documentation on [generating a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
    *   Once your public key (e.g., `id_rsa.pub`) is added via the Move's web interface, you'll need to configure the path to your private SSH key within Move Set Manager's settings.
*   **Git:** This software uses Git for versioning your sets. Make sure [Git](https://git-scm.com) is installed and available in your system's command line.
*   **Node.js:** Node.js version 22 or higher is required. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Development stack
* Electron based app in TypeScript
